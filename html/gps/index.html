What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semnatic tags are not just used for the layout of a document, but also clarify the meaning of elements within the HTML document. This makes it easier to understand/read. for example, a <div> tag doesnt give much explination about the content. A tag such as <main> allows you to understand it is the main part of the document, <article> clarifies what the content is, and <section> clarifies that the content is a section of the parent element. I also think the <nav> tag is especially useful because it specifies that the <a> is linking you to another document or page.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements in the order which they are presented. So in <html> the <head> comes before the <body>. The elements within the body will also display in the order they are listed. so in my below example, the header will display before the paragraph.

	<h1>hello</h1>
		<p>This is my paragraph</p>


What did you learn about sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I was not aware that you could make snippets, so this challenge introduced me to this handy tool. Yes i definitely think that I will create more snippets because they make a huge difference in efficency and time. The snippet I have for html is very useful and saves a lot of time. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I didnt find any concept of this challenge particularly challenging. I feel very comfortable with HTML and feel like I have a good understanding of it. <!-->
