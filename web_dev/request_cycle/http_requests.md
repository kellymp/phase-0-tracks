**What are some common HTTP status codes?**

* 200 Ok - request succeeded
* 202 Accepted - request has been accepted for processing but processing is not complete
* 400 Bad Request - the server could not understand the request due to bad syntax
* 403 Forbidden - the request was valid but denied becuase the user doesnt have authorization
* 404 Not Found - the server cannot find anything that matches the request 
* 408 Request Timeout - a request was supplied within a reasonable amount of time
* 500 Internal Server Error - the server encountered an unexpected problem that prevented the request from being fulfilled

**What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?**

* *GET request*- requests data from a specified resource. They should be used only to retrieve data and should never be used when dealing with sensitive data. They remain in the browser history and can be bookmarked.

* *POST request*- submits data to be processed to a specified resource and is used for sensitive data. They do not remain in the browser history and cannot be bookmarked.

**BONUS: What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?** 

* A cookie is a small text file, containing no executbale code, that is stored on a user's machine by a browser. Web servers use this information to identify an individual user. For example, sites requiring a log-in will set a cookie once the user's credentials have been verified, allowing the user to navigate freely throughout the site as long as the cookie is still present. 

* A cookie is stored when a web server sends a HTTP request header called a Set-Cookie. It has the following format: 

```
Set-Cookie: <em>value</em>[; expires=<em>date</em>][; domain=<em>domain</em>][; path=<em>path</em>][; secure]
```
